**Mark your calendars!**

Next Monday November 2nd at 5pm CET we will host a 30-minute community call to update you on exciting progress and to show you what we’ll be working towards in the coming months. We highly recommend you attend!

The following week we will host an AMA (Ask Me Anything) to answer any questions you might have related or unrelated to the community call.

Call details forthcoming!
